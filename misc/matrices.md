# Notes about matrices

How matrices can transform geometry in 2D or 3D space. Linear algebra.

## Matrix multiplication

Multiplying a matrix with a vector will transform the vector. You can rotate, scale or translate a vector with a matrix multiplication.

The matrix describes a transformation in a compact and concise way.

### Rotation

### Scaling

### Translation
Because a translation is an additive operation. In order to perform a translation to a 2D/3D object with a matrix, we have to use a 3 or 4 dimensional matrix and multiply it to the vector we want to translate. What we are actually doing is making shear transformation on the next dimension and getting the projection or shadow of that will give us the translated position of that object.
